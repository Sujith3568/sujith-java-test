# Task 1: Palindrome Checker 
In class PalindromChecker the static method isPalindrome() will accept the String argument as the parameter and return the boolean value(true or false).<br>
Initially the received String is cleaned and converted into lowercase letter by using .replaceAll() and .toLowerCase() method.<br>
Then using StringBuilder and .reverse() method the cleaned string is revesed and stored.<br> 
By using .equals() the isPalindrome() return true if revered string and cleaned string are same otherwise false.<br>
In the main method the isPalindrome() method is called along with sending the string as argument and the result is printed.<br>
To run the code/file<br> 
      In the terminal:    javac PalindromeChecker.java <br>
                      then <br>  java PalindromeChecker

# Task 2: Simple Employee Class
The constructor of Employee class is created which take 3 parameter.<br> 
increaseSalary() method  will increase the salary by the percentage that the user is provided.<br>
In the main method the 2 employees object are created.<br>
The first employee salary is increased by 10% by calling the increaseSalary() method and sending the 10% as the argument.<br>
Finally printed both employee details where first employee salary is increased by 10% and the second employee salary remain same.<br>
To run the code/file <br>
      In the terminal:    javac SimpleEmployeeClass.java <br>
                      then <br>  java SimpleEmployeeClass
                      
# Task 3: Database Query Simulator
The getOpenCases() method will take the list of cases as argument and return the list of cases whose status = open.<br>
The for each loop will iterate through the list and with the use of .equalsIgnoreCase() and .add() method the cases with status = open are added to separate list.<br>
Inside the main method 5 sample cases are created and added to the list. <br>
This list is send to the getOpencases() method as the argument.<br>
The list of cases whose status = open are printed.<br>
To run the code/file <br>
      In the terminal:    javac DatabaseQuerySimulator.java <br>
                      then <br>  java DatabaseQuerySimulator
